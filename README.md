This is an interactive art project created with p5.js. The project combines visual effects and audio interaction to create a dynamic visual experience. This project serves as a learning exercise for p5.js and is developed using the Cursor editor.

## Development Environment

- **Editor**: [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) - A modern AI-powered code editor
- **Version Control**: Git for version control
- **Development Tools**: Chrome DevTools for debugging and performance optimization

## Features

- **Starry Sky Effect**:
  - Dynamic star system rotating around the bottom-right corner
  - Smooth clockwise rotation animation
  - Random variations in star size and brightness
  - Full canvas coverage distribution

- **Audio Interaction**:
  - Real-time audio input visualization
  - Star brightness changes with audio intensity
  - Volume meter displaying current audio levels
  - Audio-triggered twinkling effects

- **Visual Effects**:
  - Star glow effects
  - Dynamic twinkling system
  - Smooth animation transitions
  - Dark background enhancing visual effects

## Tech Stack

- p5.js - For creating interactive visual effects
- Web Audio API - For audio processing and visualization
- HTML5 & CSS3 - For page structure and styling
- Cursor AI - For development assistance and code generation

## How to Run

1. Ensure your browser supports Web Audio API
2. Open `index.html` file
3. Allow microphone access (for audio input)
4. Start interacting with the visual effects!

## Interaction Methods

- Speak or play music to influence the visual effects
- Observe how stars change brightness and size with audio input
- Enjoy the rotation and twinkling effects of the stars
- Monitor real-time feedback on the volume meter

## Development Notes

This project serves as a learning and creative exercise in p5.js. It demonstrates how to:
- Create dynamic visual effects using p5.js
- Integrate audio input and visualization
- Implement smooth animation effects
- Create interactive art experiences
- Use Cursor editor for efficient development
- Leverage AI assistance to accelerate development

## Future Plans

- [ ] Try to add instrument and record it.
